                        Science and Information Technology at St. Xavier's College Maitighar, Kathmandu, seventh 
                        semester. While Iâ€™m currently studying, I have quite a knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, and an 
                        understanding of the full lifecycle of software development projects. <span> Also, I am familiar with 
                            WordPress and a little with the Laravel framework. My key strength is that I strive to maintain accuracy and consistency 
                            in task completion, individual performance, and team goal achievement. </span> </p>
